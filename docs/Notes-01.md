# Version 1

Below is a C++ program for a simple terminal emulator on Linux that creates a pseudo-terminal pair (master and slave) and runs `/bin/sh` on the slave side. The program handles basic input/output between the master and the terminal, allowing the user to interact with the shell.

The program:
- Uses POSIX functions like `posix_openpt`, `grantpt`, and `unlockpt` to set up the pseudo-terminal.
- Forks a child process to run `/bin/sh` on the slave side.
- Reads input from `stdin` (user) and writes to the master, and reads from the master to output to `stdout`.
- Includes basic error handling and proper terminal setup.

### How to Compile and Run
1. Save the code as `terminal_emulator.cpp`.
2. Compile with g++ (ensure you have the necessary libraries, typically available on Linux):
   ```bash
   g++ -o terminal_emulator terminal_emulator.cpp
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./terminal_emulator
   ```

### What It Does
- Creates a pseudo-terminal pair using `posix_openpt`.
- The child process runs `/bin/sh` on the slave side, redirecting its input/output to the slave.
- The parent process uses `select` to handle I/O between the master (shell) and the user's `stdin`/`stdout`.
- Sets the terminal to raw mode to handle input character-by-character without buffering or echoing.
- Restores terminal settings when done.
- Exits when the shell exits or an error occurs.

### Notes
- This is a basic terminal emulator. It supports running `/bin/sh` and basic I/O but doesn't handle advanced terminal features like signal handling (e.g., Ctrl+C) or terminal resizing.
- If you need additional features (e.g., handling signals, colors, or specific terminal capabilities), let me know, and I can extend the code!
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions and that `/bin/sh` exists on your system.
- The program assumes a POSIX-compliant Linux environment.
