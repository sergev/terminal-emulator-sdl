# Version 15

The issue of the terminal emulator looping forever on the `ESC c` sequence (`\033c`) is likely caused by a bug in the ANSI parsing logic or an unintended interaction in the state machine that prevents the program from exiting the parsing loop correctly. After reviewing the provided code, the most probable cause is in the handling of the `ESC c` sequence within the `AnsiState::ESCAPE` state. Specifically, the sequence might not be properly resetting the state machine, causing the parser to get stuck or repeatedly process the same input. Additionally, the interaction with the pseudo-terminal output loop could contribute to this behavior if the `ESC c` sequence triggers unexpected output or state changes.

### Diagnosis
- **Parsing Logic**: The `ESC c` sequence is handled in the `AnsiState::ESCAPE` state by checking for `c` after `\033`. If the state transition or sequence clearing is mishandled, the parser might not return to `AnsiState::NORMAL` correctly, leading to an infinite loop.
- **Pseudo-Terminal Output**: The `ESC c` sequence may cause the shell (`/bin/sh`) to produce output or reset its state, which could flood the `master_fd` with data, causing the `select` loop to process repeatedly without advancing.
- **Texture Cache Clearing**: The `ESC c` handler clears the entire `texture_cache` and marks all lines dirty, which is computationally intensive. If this triggers excessive rendering or interacts poorly with the event loop, it could contribute to perceived looping.

### Fix Approach
1. **Fix ANSI Parsing**:
   - Ensure the `ESC c` sequence is processed atomically and correctly transitions the state machine back to `AnsiState::NORMAL`.
   - Avoid redundant or incorrect sequence accumulation in `ansi_seq`.
2. **Optimize `ESC c` Handler**:
   - Streamline the screen clearing and texture cache reset to prevent excessive computation.
   - Ensure the cursor and attributes are reset without triggering unexpected behavior in the pseudo-terminal.
3. **Debug Output Handling**:
   - Add logging to trace the parsing of `ESC c` and check for unexpected output from `master_fd`.
   - Limit the number of iterations in the output processing loop to prevent infinite looping.
4. **Preserve Functionality**:
   - Maintain per-character foreground/background colors, Tab key handling, blinking cursor, special key support, dynamic resizing, and job control.
   - Ensure compatibility with Linux and macOS.

### Updated Code
The following C++ code fixes the infinite loop issue by refining the `ESC c` parsing logic and optimizing the handler. The changes focus on the `AnsiState::ESCAPE` case and the `process_ansi_sequence` function to ensure proper state transitions and efficient clearing. Logging is added to help diagnose any further issues, and the output loop is adjusted to prevent excessive processing.

### Key Changes
1. **Fixed `ESC c` Parsing**:
   - Ensured the `AnsiState::ESCAPE` state correctly handles `c` and transitions back to `AnsiState::NORMAL`:
     ```cpp
     case AnsiState::ESCAPE:
         if (c == '[') {
             state = AnsiState::CSI;
             ansi_seq += c;
             std::cerr << "Received [, transitioning to CSI state" << std::endl;
         } else if (c == 'c') {
             std::cerr << "Received ESC c, processing reset" << std::endl;
             process_ansi_sequence("", c); // Handle ESC c
             state = AnsiState::NORMAL;
             ansi_seq.clear();
         } else {
             std::cerr << "Unknown ESC sequence char: " << c << ", resetting to NORMAL" << std::endl;
             state = AnsiState::NORMAL;
             ansi_seq.clear();
         }
         break;
     ```
   - Explicitly clears `ansi_seq` and resets the state to prevent accumulation of invalid sequences.

2. **Optimized `ESC c` Handler**:
   - Streamlined the screen clearing in `process_ansi_sequence`:
     ```cpp
     if (final_char == 'c') { // ESC c: Full reset and clear screen
         std::cerr << "Processing ESC c: Resetting terminal state" << std::endl;
         // Reset attributes
         current_attr = CharAttr();
         // Reset cursor
         cursor.row = 0;
         cursor.col = 0;
         // Clear screen
         for (int r = 0; r < term_rows; ++r) {
             text_buffer[r] = std::vector<Char>(term_cols, {' ', current_attr});
             dirty_lines[r] = true;
             // Clear texture cache for this line
             for (auto& span : texture_cache[r]) {
                 if (span.texture) SDL_DestroyTexture(span.texture);
             }
             texture_cache[r].clear();
         }
         return;
     }
     ```
   - Replaced `text_buffer[r] = ...` with a new vector to ensure a clean reset, avoiding potential memory issues.
   - Ensured texture cache is cleared efficiently by iterating only once per line.

3. **Added Logging**:
   - Added `std::cerr` statements to trace state transitions and sequence processing:
     - Logs when `ESC` is received, when transitioning to `CSI`, and when `ESC c` is processed.
     - Logs unknown escape sequence characters to help diagnose issues.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     std::cerr << "Received ESC c, processing reset" << std::endl;
     ```

4. **Output Loop Safety**:
   - Added error checking for `read` from `master_fd` to prevent infinite looping on errors:
     ```cpp
     } else if (bytes < 0 && errno != EAGAIN && errno != EWOULDBLOCK) {
         std::cerr << "Error reading from master_fd: " << strerror(errno) << std::endl;
         running = false;
     }
     ```
   - Ensures the program exits gracefully on unexpected errors, avoiding hangs.

5. **Preserved Functionality**:
   - Per-character foreground/background colors, Tab key handling, blinking cursor, special keys (arrow, Home, etc.), dynamic resizing, antialiased text, double buffering, and job control remain unchanged.
   - Other ANSI sequences (e.g., SGR, cursor movement, clear) are unaffected.

### Testing
1. **ESC c Sequence**:
   - Run `echo -e "\033c"` and verify:
     - The screen clears completely.
     - The cursor moves to (0, 0) and blinks.
     - Colors reset to white text on black background.
     - No infinite loop or hang occurs.
   - Check the console output for logs like:
     ```
     Received ESC, transitioning to ESCAPE state
     Received ESC c, processing reset
     Processing ESC c: Resetting terminal state
     ```
   - Run `echo -e "\033[41mRedBG\033[32mGreenText\033c"; ls --color` to confirm colors reset and `ls --color` uses default colors until new sequences.
   - In `vim`, type `:r!echo -e "\033c"` and verify the screen clears and the cursor resets without hanging.

2. **Background/Foreground Colors**:
   - Run `ls --color` to verify mixed colors (e.g., blue directories, green executables).
   - Test `echo -e "\033[41mRedBG\033[42mGreenBG\033[0m"` for background color changes.
   - Ensure `ESC c` resets colors correctly.

3. **Tab Key**:
   - In `bash`, type `ls` and press Tab to trigger completion.
   - In `vim`, press Tab in insert mode to insert a tab or spaces.

4. **Blinking Cursor**:
   - Verify the cursor blinks at (0, 0) after `echo -e "\033c"`.
   - Ensure it moves correctly with typing, Tab, arrow keys, or `tput cup 5 10`.

5. **Special Keys**:
   - In `vim`, use arrow keys, Home, End, Insert, Delete, Page Up/Down, and F1â€“F12, ensuring colors and cursor behave correctly.
   - In `less file.txt`, press Page Up/Down to verify scrolling.

6. **Dynamic Resizing**:
   - Resize the window and run `stty size` to confirm dimensions.
   - Verify `vim` adjusts with correct colors after `ESC c`.

7. **Rendering**:
   - Run `vim` or `top` to check flicker-free rendering with per-character colors.
   - Ensure no gaps or overlaps in spans after `ESC c`.

8. **Job Control**:
   - Run `sleep 100 &` and use `fg` or `bg`, confirming colors and cursor behavior.
   - Press Ctrl+Z to suspend and resume.

### Debugging Tips
If the infinite loop persists:
- **Check Logs**: Review the `std::cerr` output to see the sequence of state transitions. Look for repeated or stuck states (e.g., staying in `ESCAPE`).
- **Test with Simple Input**: Run `echo -e "\033c"` directly and observe the behavior. If it hangs, note the last log message.
- **Reduce Output**: Temporarily comment out the `read` loop after `ESC c` to isolate whether the pseudo-terminal is flooding the buffer:
  ```cpp
  if (bytes > 0) {
      // Log buffer for debugging
      std::cerr << "Read " << bytes << " bytes: ";
      for (ssize_t j = 0; j < bytes; ++j) {
          std::cerr << (int)buffer[j] << " ";
      }
      std::cerr << std::endl;
      // Process buffer...
  }
  ```
- **Test on Both Platforms**: Verify if the issue is specific to Linux or macOS, as pseudo-terminal behavior may differ.

### Notes
- **Font Path**: Update `TTF_OpenFont` if the font fails to load (e.g., `LiberationMono.ttf` on Linux or another `.ttc` on macOS).
- **ESC c Behavior**:
  - Resets colors, cursor, and clears the screen. It does not reset terminal modes (e.g., `termios` settings), as these are handled by the slave terminal. Additional resets can be added if needed.
- **Performance**:
  - The optimized `ESC c` handler minimizes texture cache clearing overhead.
  - Spans ensure efficient rendering for per-character colors.
- **ANSI Support**:
  - Supports `ESC c`, foreground/background colors, cursor movement, and clear sequences. Additional sequences can be added if required.
- **Special Keys**:
  - All requested keys (arrow, Home, End, Insert, Delete, Page Up/Down, F1â€“F12, Tab) are supported.
